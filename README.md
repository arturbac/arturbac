# Welcome! I'm Artur BaÄ‡ ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer and thinker at the intersection of **Modern C++ Programming**, and **Civil Engineering**. With each line of code, I seek not just to solve problems but to explore the potential of what programming can achieve in these fields.

## What Drives Me

- ðŸš€ **Innovation in C++**: The advent of C++20 has opened up new horizons in programming. I'm on a continuous journey to harness these innovations, aiming to write code that's not only efficient and powerful but also elegant and expressive.

- ðŸŒŒ **Physics & Engineering**: Beyond code, my interests lie in understanding the universe's fundamental principles and applying engineering solutions to real-world challenges.

## Connect with Me

- ðŸ“¬ **Reach Out**: Whether it's a project collaboration, a question, or simply to exchange ideas, I'm all ears. You can email me at: ebasoft at ebasoft.com.pl.
